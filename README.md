# cricketscorebook

For my dissertation project I had to create a dynamic cricket score book.

This involved creating an API from scratch using Node and Express, as well as having a clean and suitable front end. For the front end Angular and Bootstrap were used. 

For the database connectivity MongoDB was used with Mongoose.

The API has full unit testing with high (~99%) code coverage.
